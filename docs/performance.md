# Performance Analysis & Optimizations

## Board clone elimination in move generation (done)

**Problem**: Every piece movement function (`queen_moves`, `beetle_moves`, `spider_moves`,
`ant_moves`, `grasshopper_moves`) cloned the entire `Board` to temporarily remove the piece
before computing destinations. `Board` contains `Box<[[StackSlot; 23]; 23]>` — 4,232 bytes
heap-allocated per clone. In `valid_moves()`, this happened for every moveable piece (up to 11),
meaning up to 11 heap allocations per `valid_moves()` call.

**Fix**: Changed `get_moves()` to take `&mut Board`, remove the piece, compute moves, then
restore it. Same semantics, zero allocation. `valid_moves()` signature changed from `&self`
to `&mut self` accordingly.

**Impact**: Modest improvement for replay (~2%), but more significant for MCTS where
`valid_moves()` is called per simulation.

## Remaining opportunities

### MCTS: full Game clone per tree node (done)

Each `MctsNode` stored `pub game: Game`, and `expand_with_policy` cloned the game for every
child. `Game` contains `Board` (4KB heap), `Vec<Move>` history, and `Vec<(u16, u16)>` reserve
history. A tree with 10K nodes = ~40MB just for board clones, causing massive cache thrashing.

**Fix**: Removed `game` from `MctsNode` entirely. Nodes now store only metadata (~60 bytes:
move, prior, visit stats, turn_color, child links). `MctsSearch` stores the root game and
reconstructs game state at any node by replaying moves from root via the parent chain.
`select_leaves()` returns `(NodeId, Game)` pairs — the reconstructed game is used for
encoding and expansion, then discarded.

**Impact**: Per-node memory drops from ~4KB+ to ~60 bytes. 10K node tree: ~40MB → ~600KB.
Reconstruction cost is O(depth) `play_move` calls per leaf (~15-20 moves, microseconds each),
negligible vs GPU eval time.

### `parse_and_play_uhp` valid-moves bypass for replay (done)

Replay used to call `valid_moves()` for every move just to validate it. Now
`play_uhp_unchecked()` skips validation entirely — parses the UHP string and applies the
move directly. Board mutations return `Result` so invalid moves are caught without panicking.

### Direct SGF → Game replay, eliminating UHP string round-trip (done)

**Problem**: The SGF parser (`sgf::parse_moves`) built a `Vec<String>` of UHP move strings,
then `play_uhp_unchecked` re-parsed those strings back into `Move` structs. This involved:
- `HashMap<String, Vec<String>>` for Boardspace coord→piece tracking
- `HashMap<String, String>` for piece→coord tracking
- Hundreds of `format!()`, `to_lowercase()`, `to_uppercase()` allocations per game
- UHP reference resolution (direction notation like "/wQ") that then got re-parsed

**Fix**: `sgf::replay_into_game()` converts Boardspace grid coordinates directly to hex
coordinates using a linear mapping (`q = col - origin_col`, `r = -(row - origin_row)`),
derived from the direction conventions in the old `drop_down_ref` function. Piece names are
parsed directly to `Piece` structs. No UHP strings, no HashMaps, no string allocations in
the hot loop. The `Game` state itself tracks piece positions, so no separate coord bookkeeping
is needed.

**Impact**: 12x faster replay (100s → 8s for 238K games). Also fixed ~2,800 games (97.8% →
99.7% success) that previously failed due to bugs in UHP reference string generation — the
direct coord path has no reference resolution to get wrong.

### Linear `.contains()` checks instead of bitset (medium impact)

- `articulation_points.contains(&pos)` — linear scan, called per piece
- `candidates.contains(&n)` in `get_placements` — linear dedup
- `visited.contains(&neighbor)` in `walk_any` (ant) — worst case, many hexes

**Fix**: Use a grid-indexed bitset (23×23 = 529 bits = 9 `u64`s) for O(1) lookups.

### `Vec` where fixed arrays suffice (low-medium impact)

Functions like `empty_neighbors` (max 6), `pieces_on_board` (max 11), `pieces_in_reserve`
(max 11) return heap-allocated `Vec`s. These could use `ArrayVec` or `SmallVec` to stay
on the stack.

### `can_slide` does O(36) work when O(1) is possible (low impact)

Computes `hex_neighbors` twice (12 entries) then does a nested loop (36 comparisons) to find
2 common neighbors. Since hex directions are fixed, common neighbors of adjacent hexes can be
computed directly from the direction index.

## Benchmarks

Full corpus replay (238K games, 146K base):
- Rust binary (UHP string round-trip): ~100s
- After board clone elimination: ~98s
- After direct SGF→Game replay: ~8s
